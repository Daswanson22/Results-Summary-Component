### What I learned

Throughout your exploration of HTML and CSS, you have gained a solid understanding of various concepts and techniques. You have learned how to structure and organize web content using HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.

In terms of CSS, you have learned how to style and customize HTML elements using properties like color, font-size, background-color, and padding. You have also delved into layout techniques, including using display: flex; and display: grid; to create flexible and responsive designs.

You have discovered how to link CSS files to HTML documents, enabling the separation of style and content. Furthermore, you have explored the power of CSS selectors, allowing you to target and style specific elements with precision.

In addition to the fundamental concepts, you have explored advanced topics, such as creating gradients, positioning elements using absolute or relative, and utilizing pseudo-elements to add custom styling elements.

You have also gained knowledge about the usage of comments in CSS for documentation and code organization. Furthermore, you have learned about GitHub Desktop and its functionalities, including initializing a repository, making commits, and publishing projects to GitHub.
